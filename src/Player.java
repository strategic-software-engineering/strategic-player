/**
 * A player of the Spin-the-Wheel Coin Matching Game.
 *<br><br>
 * Strategy for a 4 coin, 2 reveal game: <br>
 * The player will first request that two adjacent coins are revealed, 
 * which will be "??--". If these two coins are the same, getNewCoinStates
 * will flip both of them. Since the game cannot begin with a winning
 * spin, this gives us an immediate 1/3 chance of victory if the two
 * hidden coins are the same. If they are not the same, it ensures that
 * at least 3 of the coins now match.<br>
 * If the coins are not the same, getNewCoinStates will flip one so that
 * the pattern is "HH". This ensures that at least 2 coins match in the
 * worst case scenario, and has a 1/4 chance of victory.<br>
 * For the second move, the player will request that two opposite coins
 * are revealed in the pattern "?-?-". This ensures, in the worst case
 * scenario, that three coins match, and has a 1/2 chance of victory.
 * For all subsequent moves, the same "?-?-" pattern will be requested,
 * which gives each of these moves a 1/2 chance of victory. <br>
 * The probability for success for this strategy in the event that the
 * first two coins match is: P=1/3 for the first move, and P=1-(1/2)^n,
 * where n equals the number of moves after the first one, for all
 * subsequent moves. The probability of winning in 9 moves is 99.96%<br>
 * The probability for success for this strategy when the first two
 * coins do not match is: P=1/4 for the first move, and P=1-(1/2)^n,
 * where n equals the number of moves after the first one, for all 
 * subsequent moves. The probability of winning in 9 moves is 99.2%<br>
